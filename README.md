This program uses the Django framework to create a simple web application with a single API endpoint /hello/. When a POST request is made to this endpoint with a JSON payload containing a name field, it returns a JSON response with a greeting message. If the request is invalid or missing the name field, it returns an error response.

To use this program, follow these steps :

Install Django by running pip install django in your Python environment.

Create a new Django project by running django-admin startproject myproject in your desired directory. Replace myproject with the desired project name.

Move the provided Python code into a file named views.py within the project directory.

Open the urls.py file within the project directory and replace its content with the following code:
```python

from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('hello/', views.hello),
]
```
Save the files and navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.

Run the Django development server by executing the command python manage.py runserver.

Open a web browser and visit http://localhost:8000/hello/. You should see an error response since it's a GET request.

Use a tool like cURL or Postman to make a POST request to http://localhost:8000/hello/ with a JSON payload containing a name field. For example:

```bash

POST http://localhost:8000/hello/

Request Body:
{
  "name": "John"
}
You should receive a JSON response with a greeting message:
json

{
  "message": "Hello, John!"
}
```
You can now upload the project to your GitHub repository by following the usual steps for creating a new repository and pushing your code to it. Make sure to include the Django project files and the requirements.txt file (generated using pip freeze) if applicable.
